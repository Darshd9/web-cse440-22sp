# Assignment 4: Communicating Your Design

<Alert severity='error'>Content is Under Development and Subject to Change</Alert>

## Overview

You have identified a problem, explored a design space, selected a promising design, and iterated on that design.
It is now time to focus on communicating your design and your design process.
This group assignment communicates your design through
a __web post__ and through a __poster__ with an associated __pitch__.

## Milestones and Deliverables

This is a group assignment, consisting of five milestones.

{/*
### 2web: Getting the Right Design

<p><CourseInformationDueDate dueDateName='dueDateAssignment2web' /></p>

The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design research in a post appropriate for a web portfolio.

Prepare a post documenting your process of getting the right design.
Your post will be integrated into the course website via a Projects page,
used to both advertise the course poster session and to provide an archive of course projects.
Your post should follow the outline below, and you will also need to provide:
(1) a project title, (2) a project thumbnail, and (3) an image and preferred name for each member of the project team.

The outline and its description of what to include in each section is intended to help convey your design process.
For example, you might begin your section on identified tasks by saying "_We focused our design exploration around 6 tasks._",
thus mirroring the outline's language regarding your overall design process.
Each section suggests an organization that will often be effective,
but you should adapt the section as appropriate to your specific design process.

Your prior milestones provide significant content you can draw upon in this post,
but this post is intended for an audience of future readers reviewing your design work.
Not all of the content from prior milestones is included (e.g., the Task Analysis is not included),
you should update your prior work based on feedback received throughout your design process,
and you may choose to omit elements of your work that were ultimately less relevant to your design process.

1. __Title__

   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.

2. __Problem and Solution Overview__:

   A concise statement of the problem you are addressing and a brief introduction of your proposed solution.

   This could be organized as two short paragraphs: one introducing the problem and one introducing your solution.

3. __Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants__:

   Describe the goals of your design research (i.e., your focus, your primary need for additional understanding),
   the methods you applied in your design research toward these goals,
   and the participants you engaged in your design research.
   Describe why you chose your specific methods and participants.

   This could be a chronological account of your design research,
   explaining how you combined multiple methods over time (e.g., a survey and then follow-up interviews)
   or how your design research goals evolved across participants (e.g., a major pivot after an interview).

   Minimize how much this section reveals about your results,
   including only what may be necessary to explain your methods and participants.

4. __Design Research Results and Themes__:

   Discuss the key insights and themes that emerged in your design research
   (e.g., common needs, common practices, critical breakdowns, identified opportunities).
   Use specific evidence whenever possible
   (e.g., quotes or stories from participants, pictures captured during observations),
   so that readers know that insights and themes are based in design research data.

   This could be organized as a short introduction followed by a paragraph for each insight or theme.
   Each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight or theme,
   then several sentences explaining the specific evidence or other design research data supporting the insight or theme.

5. __Identified Tasks__:

   Present 6 tasks around which you decided to focus your design exploration.
   Provide brief justification for each task, based in your design research.

   This could be organized as a short introduction followed by a short paragraph for each task.
   Each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the task,
   then another sentence explaining the specific evidence or other design research data supporting the task.
   For example, the latter sentence might explain that an existing task was commonly described by participants,
   might explain how a critical breakdown identified by a participant motivates importance of the task,
   or might describe how a theme identified in design research suggests a new task.

   Remember tasks describe design-agnostic objectives that people accomplish.
   Although you may have also developed detailed scenarios or personas,
   tasks in this section should be relatively brief and focused on
   what people need or want to accomplish in the space your designs will address.

6. __Proposed Design Sketches__:

   Present 3 distinct designs that each take a different approach to your problem
   and are each motivated by your design research.
   Explain the key ideas in each design
   and include one or more images of your sketches for each design.
   Be sure your explanation and images are sufficient for understanding each design
   and for also understanding how the designs are distinct from each other.

   This could be organized as a short introduction that names each design followed by a paragraph for each design.
   Each paragraph could include one or more images of your sketches for that design.

7. __Selected Design and Storyboards__:

   Present: (1) the design you will develop in the remainder of the course,
   (2) a justification for why you chose that design based on your design research,
   and (3) images of your storyboards illustrating 2 tasks with your design.
   Be sure your storyboards appropriately illustrate key elements of your design
   and communicate how a person will accomplish the task using your design.

   This could be organized as an introductory paragraph justifying a selected design,
   or could instead justify a decision to take key elements from multiple designs in a new design.
   Storyboards could be presented together with written scenarios
   describing steps a person will go through to accomplish the tasks using your design,
   thus providing additional detail necessary for interpreting and understanding your storyboards.

Ensure your post is appropriately clear and easy to read. This includes:

 - Text should be clear and concise.
 - Use section headings and formatting as appropriate.
 - Include images in the body of the post.
 - Check for typos, spelling, and grammar errors.

#### Submission

Evidence suggests that effective posts can be read in approximately 7 minutes:

[https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b](https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b)

Author your post such that it conveys the necessary content while remaining easy to skim and read within approximately 7 minutes.
We estimate posts will be between 1500 and 2000 words in length.

Your post must be a plain text file, formatted in Markdown syntax:

[https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

<Alert severity='error'>Content Submission Format is Under Development and Subject to Change</Alert>

{/*
Name the file `designresearch.md`. In addition to your Markdown file, you will also need to provide:

1. __A Project Thumbnail__:
   A 150x150 image appropriate as a thumbnail for your project, named `project_thumb.png`.

2. __An image and preferred name for each member of the project team__:
   Similar to the images of the course staff on the overall course website, these will be included in the pages generated for your project.
   Provide a file `names.txt` that includes how you want your names presented on the course website.
   Then provide an appropriately named image for each member of the project team (e.g., `james.png`).

3. __All images referenced by your Markdown file__:
   These will be placed in the same directory as your rendered Markdown file.
   Instead of Markdown's image syntax, consider incorporating `img` tags directly in your Markdown,
   thus allowing you to specify the rendering size of the image.

### 3web: Getting the Design Right

<p><CourseInformationDueDate dueDateName='dueDateAssignment3web' /></p>

The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design prototyping in a post appropriate for a web portfolio.

Prepare a post documenting your process of getting the design right.
Your post will be integrated into the course website via a Projects page,
used to both advertise the course poster session and to provide an archive of course projects.
Your post should follow the outline below, and will be posted together with the content from your prior post.

Your prior milestones provide significant content you can draw upon in this post,
but this post is intended for an audience of future readers reviewing your design work.
Not all of the content from prior milestones is included
(e.g., you will convey both specific usability issues and higher-level findings,
but do not need to provide an exhaustive enumeration of changes made in your processes),
you should update your prior work based on feedback received throughout your design process,
and you may choose to omit elements of your work that were ultimately less relevant to your design process.

1. __Title__

   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.

2. __Problem and Solution Overview__:

   A concise statement of the problem you are addressing and a brief introduction of your proposed solution.

   It is appropriate to assume that a reader of this post will have already read your previous post.
   Therefore briefly set context for your iterative design in Assignment 3 without repeating the full context from Assignment 2.

   This could be organized as an introduction of key themes from your design research and how that motivated your initial design.

3.  __Initial Paper Prototype__:

    Present your initial paper prototype.
    Convey the critical aspects of your design,
    including the two primary tasks being refined in your paper prototype.
    This provides a baseline upon which to report iterative prototyping and refinement of your design.

4.  __Testing Process__:

    Present your testing process, including your method and your participants.
    This process probably evolved in the course of your testing
    (e.g., as your design or focus evolved through testing).
    Include a retrospective on how you refined your process, distinct from how you refined your design.

5.  __Testing Results and Prototype Refinement__:

	Present usability and design issues that you identified and iterative improvements you made to address those issues.
    This will include changes from your heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and design critique.

    Discuss identified issues as an appropriate level of detail, including:
    - specific usability issues that were identified and corrected (e.g., consider before and after comparisons),
    - higher-level findings and themes that emerged (e.g., consider explaining a specific issue that was identified and how it led to a larger revision of the design).

    Consider different potential organizations of your results and design progression, including:
    - a chronological organization, discussing what you learned about each version of your prototype and what changes you made as a result,
    - a bottom-up organization, starting from specific issues and discussing how they revealed higher-level findings and changes,
    - a top-down organization, starting from higher-level themes and showing how they applied in specific design changes.

6.  __Final Paper Prototype__:

    Present your final version of your paper prototype, as you did for your initial paper prototype above.
    Convey the critical aspects of your design,
    including the two primary tasks being refined in your paper prototype.

7.  __Digital Mockup__:

    Present your digital mockup.
    Convey the critical aspects of your design,
    including the two primary tasks being refined in your paper prototype.

    Include descriptions of how your design supports each of your primary tasks
    (e.g., as scenarios demonstrating the task in your final design).
    Briefly reflect on any changes you needed to make as you switched to digital tools from your paper prototype.

Ensure your post is appropriately clear and easy to read. This includes:

 - text should be clear and concise
 - use section headings and formatting as appropriate
 - include images in the body of the post
 - check for typos, spelling, and grammar errors

  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone heading='4web: Web Post' dueDateName='dueDateAssignment4web'>

The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design
and your underlying design process in a post appropriate for a web portfolio.

Prepare a post documenting your process of getting the right design and then getting the design right.
Your post will be integrated into the course website via a Projects page,
used to both advertise the course poster session and to provide an archive of course projects.
Your prior milestones provide significant content you can draw upon in this post,
but this post is intended for an audience of future readers reviewing your design work.
Not all content from prior milestones will be included,
you may choose to update your prior work based on feedback received throughout your design process
(e.g., re-making a design sketch or storyboard for clarity in this communication),
and you will ultimately emphasize a few key insights that most informed your design.

Your post should follow the outline below, and you will also need to provide:
(1) a project title, (2) a project thumbnail, and (3) an image and preferred name for each member of the project team.

1. __Title__

   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.

2. __Problem and Design Overview__:

   Provide a concise statement of the problem you are addressing and a brief introduction of your design.

   This might be a single paragraph or two short paragraphs.
   You should likely include an image from or of your design to help serve as a "hook".
   Your goal is to set a context and then to motivate a reader to want to continue to learn about your work.

3. __Design Research Process and Key Insights__:

   First provide a concise overview of your design research process in Assignment 2,
   including the goals of your design research (i.e., your focus, your primary need for additional understanding),
   the methods and participants you engaged in your design research,
   and your rationale (i.e., why you chose your specific methods and participants).
   Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process revealed.

   This might be a single paragraph.

   _3 Key Insights_

   Then provide 3 key insights from your design research process in Assignment 2.
   Your goal is to convey key insights that informed your design and how each insight is based in your design process.

   Each insight might be a single paragraph, perhaps with a descriptive heading.
   For each insight, discuss how the insight emerged
   (e.g., how your understanding was shaped by design research,
   how your understanding was shaped by critique or feedback).
   Use specific evidence whenever possible
   (e.g., quotes or stories from participants,
   pictures captured during observations,
   pivots in your approach or thinking that resulted from critique or feedback,
   key reasons you chose one design over alternatives,
   key reasons you combined ideas from multiple design alternatives).
   Do not number your insights (e.g., "Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3"),
   but instead give them a descriptive title (e.g., "Minimizing Burden", "Creating Social Connections")
   or consider that each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight.
   Use images as appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images from your design sketches or storyboards).

4. __Iterative Design Process and Key Insights__:

   First provide a concise overview of your iterative design process in Assignment 3,
   including your design focus (i.e., the tasks on which you focused iterative design)
   and process (e.g., your paper prototyping, inspection, usability testing, and digital mockup).
   Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process revealed.

   This might be a single paragraph.
   You should likely include an overview image of your paper prototype.

   _3 Key Insights_

   Then provide 3 key insights from your iterative design process in Assignment 3.
   Your goal is to convey key insights that informed your design and how each insight is based in your design process.

   Each insight might be a single paragraph, perhaps with a descriptive heading.
   For each insight, discuss how the insight emerged
   (e.g., the state of a design element prior to the insight,
   the activity, observation, critique, or feedback that prompted you to iterate upon a design element,
   an aspect of transitioning to a digital mockup that required re-working your design)
   and how you iterated upon the design in result
   (e.g., showing a design element before and after an iteration).
   Use specific evidence whenever possible
   (e.g., quotes from or observations of participants.
   Do not number your insights (e.g., "Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3"),
   but instead give them a descriptive title (e.g., "Simplifying Data Collection", "Improving Legibility", "Removing Gender Assumptions")
   or consider that each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight.
   Use images as appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images from your paper prototyping or digital mockup).

5. __Resulting Design__:

   Present key elements of your final design.
   Convey the critical aspects of your design,
   including the two primary tasks demonstrated in your digital mockup
   (e.g., as scenarios demonstrating the task with images from your digital mockup).

   This section may primarily be a set of images,
   but be sure you organize those images with enough text for a reader to understand the resulting design.

Ensure your post is appropriately clear and easy to read. This includes:

 - text should be clear and concise
 - use section headings and formatting as appropriate
 - include images in the body of the post
 - check for typos, spelling, and grammar errors

#### Submission

Evidence from Medium suggests that effective posts can be read in approximately 7 minutes:

[https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b](https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b)

Author your post such that it conveys the necessary content while remaining easy to skim and read within approximately 7 minutes.
We estimate posts will be between 1500 and 2000 words in length.

Be sure:

- <GroupAssignment />
- <ClarityAndPresentationReference />
- <ContributionStatementReference />
- <ParticipantAnonymity />

Prepare this initial version of your web post in a Google Doc, submit a link to that document via Canvas here:

<p><CourseInformationLink linkName='linkCanvasAssignment4web' /></p>

Be sure:

- The document can be accessed for commenting by anybody with the link.
- The document uses only simple formatting features (e.g., simple headings, a linear flow of content).
  This is because the document will be converted into Markdown syntax as part of publishing:
