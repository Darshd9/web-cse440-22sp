# Course Overview

<Alert severity='error'>Content is Under Development and Subject to Change</Alert>

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to human-computer interaction and the design process.
Students will learn methods and skills for designing and prototyping interactive systems.
The course covers a design process from the initial formulation of a design problem to creation of digital prototypes.
Importantly, the course does not emphasize development but instead fully focuses on design.

The course structure is a mix of lectures, hands-on activities, and design critiques by peers and course staff.
The course is overwhelmingly organized around a group project, in which students:

- Ideate and Propose Design Problems
- Study Existing Practices and Challenges
- Explore Potential Design Opportunities and Tradeoffs
- Evaluate and Iterate Upon a Design
- Communicate a Problem and Resulting Design

## Learning Objectives

- Process-Focused Perspective on Interaction Design
- Design Research Methods and Skills
- Task-Focused Scenario Development, Sketching, and Storyboarding
- Rapid Prototyping and Iteration
- Critical Perspective on Design Solutions

## Grading

Much of the grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
We will attempt to communicate expectations and feedback throughout the course,
but it is your responsibility to communicate with us if you would like additional guidance in this regard.

The overall course grade will be computed as follows:

- 20%: Reading Reports and In-Class Small Group Discussion

  Reading reports will be graded 0 to 2 points as described in [Reading Reports](/assignments/readings#reading-reports).
  As this offering explores a new [In-Class Discussion Format](/assignments/readings#in-class-discussion-format),
  an additional .5 points will be associated with each small group discussion and its resulting question to the presenter and the class.

- 45%: Project
  - 5%: Proposal Preparation and Document
  - 5%: Milestone 1 Report and Presentation
  - 5%: Milestone 2 Report and Presentation
  - 30%: Final Report

  Project proposal and milestone grading will emphasize progress and preparation to engage with direction and feedback.
  Strong grades will result from honest presentation of project status
  and useful scaffolding of a conversation that can support the project
  (e.g., realistic and concrete proposals, clear discussion of advice that a project currently needs).
  Proposals or milestones that are vague, incomplete, or oversold all
  fail to take full advantage of an opportunity for feedback.

  Final project report grading will then emphasize overall project execution
  and appropriate presentation of project activities (e.g., clarity of activities, methods, and contributions).

- 10%: Statistics Lab, as described in [Statistics Lab](/assignments/statisticslab).
- 15%: Exam, as described in [Exam](/assignments/exam).
- 10%: Participation

  A participation grade corresponds to course goals for students to
  actively develop skills in discussing research activities and contributions
  (e.g., when discussing existing research, when discussing ongoing research).
  Participation will therefore include presence and participation in in-class discussions,
  participation in asynchronous and in-class project discussions, and other course activities.
  A goal of this offering is to make such participation components more explicit and transparent.

  If you will be unable to participate in a course activity, please email course staff beforehand.

## Wellness and Safety

We are all living in challenging times.
Our goal is for this course to provide an opportunity for learning without undermining wellness or safety.

We will conduct many course activities virtually,
using meeting information provided by email and in [Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1519807).
The course [Calendar](/calendar) will indicate when class itself will be conducted virtually
(e.g., due to emerging UW policies, due to a need or request from a guest presenter).

We will default to recording course sessions (i.e., will record unless a guest indicates they do not want to be recorded).
Recorded sessions will be made available for asynchronous review within [Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1519807).
Although recordings are obviously an incomplete proxy for a discussion-focused course,
we will assume that all students are participating to the best of their ability given our wellness and safety goal.

Prior to class, we will accept any email indicating that a student cannot attend for reasons of wellness or safety.
We will work to ensure this does not negatively impact students (e.g., in their participation grade),
in part by developing straightforward approaches for students to "make up" a missed opportunity.

We also welcome any additional feedback in how we can best structure this course while ensuring this goal.

## Accommodations and Additional University Policies

Additional university policies apply 
(e.g., regarding Academic Integrity, Conduct, Disability Resources, Face Coverings, Religious Accommodations):

Please do not hesitate to contact the course staff regarding these or any other accommodations.
