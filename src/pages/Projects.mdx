# Project Theme

As a focus for Spring 2022,
we asked students to explore self-tracking and everyday interaction with personal intelligences.

People have long sought to better understand themselves, but continuing technology advances enable new approaches.
Students examined problems people encounter in gathering and gaining value from personal data,
then explored how a combination of design and machine intelligence
can help go beyond simple data fetishes to help people in using personal data as part of reaching their goals.
