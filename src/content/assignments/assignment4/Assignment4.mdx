# Assignment 4: Communicating Your Design

{/* <Alert severity='error'>Content is Under Development and Subject to Change</Alert> */}

## Overview

You have identified a problem, explored a design space, selected a promising design, and iterated on that design.
It is now time to focus on communicating your design and your design process.
This group assignment communicates your design through
a __web post__ and through a __poster__ with an associated __pitch__.

## Milestones and Deliverables

This is a group assignment, consisting of five milestones.

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 4 Web
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone heading='4web: Web Post' dueDateName='dueDateAssignment4web'>

The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design
and your underlying design process in a post appropriate for a web portfolio.

Prepare a post documenting your process of getting the right design and then getting the design right.
Your post will be integrated into the course website via a Projects page,
used to both advertise the course poster session and to provide an archive of course projects.
Your prior milestones provide significant content you can draw upon in this post,
but this post is intended for an audience of future readers reviewing your design work.
Not all content from prior milestones will be included,
you may choose to update your prior work based on feedback received throughout your design process
(e.g., re-making a design sketch or storyboard for clarity in this communication),
and you will ultimately emphasize a few key insights that most informed your design.

Your post should follow the outline below, and you will also need to provide:
(1) a project title, (2) a project thumbnail, and (3) an image and preferred name for each member of the project team.

1. __Title__

   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.

2. __Problem and Design Overview__:

   Provide a concise statement of the problem you are addressing and a brief introduction of your design.

   This might be a single paragraph or two short paragraphs.
   You should likely include an image from or of your design to help serve as a "hook".
   Your goal is to set a context and then to motivate a reader to want to continue to learn about your work.

3. __Design Research Process and Key Insights__:

   First provide a concise overview of your design research process in Assignment 2,
   including the goals of your design research (i.e., your focus, your primary need for additional understanding),
   the methods and participants you engaged in your design research,
   and your rationale (i.e., why you chose your specific methods and participants).
   Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process revealed.

   This might be a single paragraph.

   _3 Key Insights_

   Then provide 3 key insights from your design research process in Assignment 2.
   Your goal is to convey key insights that informed your design and how each insight is based in your design process.

   Each insight might be a single paragraph, perhaps with a descriptive heading.
   For each insight, discuss how the insight emerged
   (e.g., how your understanding was shaped by design research,
   how your understanding was shaped by critique or feedback).
   Use specific evidence whenever possible
   (e.g., quotes or stories from participants,
   pictures captured during observations,
   pivots in your approach or thinking that resulted from critique or feedback,
   key reasons you chose one design over alternatives,
   key reasons you combined ideas from multiple design alternatives).
   Do not number your insights (e.g., "Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3"),
   but instead give them a descriptive title (e.g., "Minimizing Burden", "Creating Social Connections")
   or consider that each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight.
   Use images as appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images from your design sketches or storyboards).

4. __Iterative Design Process and Key Insights__:

   First provide a concise overview of your iterative design process in Assignment 3,
   including your design focus (i.e., the tasks on which you focused iterative design)
   and process (e.g., your paper prototyping, inspection, usability testing, and digital mockup).
   Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process revealed.

   This might be a single paragraph.
   You should likely include an overview image of your paper prototype.

   _3 Key Insights_

   Then provide 3 key insights from your iterative design process in Assignment 3.
   Your goal is to convey key insights that informed your design and how each insight is based in your design process.

   Each insight might be a single paragraph, perhaps with a descriptive heading.
   For each insight, discuss how the insight emerged
   (e.g., the state of a design element prior to the insight,
   the activity, observation, critique, or feedback that prompted you to iterate upon a design element,
   an aspect of transitioning to a digital mockup that required re-working your design)
   and how you iterated upon the design in result
   (e.g., showing a design element before and after an iteration).
   Use specific evidence whenever possible
   (e.g., quotes from or observations of participants.
   Do not number your insights (e.g., "Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3"),
   but instead give them a descriptive title (e.g., "Simplifying Data Collection", "Improving Legibility", "Removing Gender Assumptions")
   or consider that each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight.
   Use images as appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images from your paper prototyping or digital mockup).

5. __Resulting Design__:

   Present key elements of your final design.
   Convey the critical aspects of your design,
   including the two primary tasks demonstrated in your digital mockup
   (e.g., as scenarios demonstrating the task with images from your digital mockup).

   This section may primarily be a set of images,
   but be sure you organize those images with enough text for a reader to understand the resulting design.

Ensure your post is appropriately clear and easy to read. This includes:

 - text should be clear and concise
 - use section headings and formatting as appropriate
 - include images in the body of the post
 - check for typos, spelling, and grammar errors

#### Submission

Evidence from Medium suggests that effective posts can be read in approximately 7 minutes:

[https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b](https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b)

Author your post such that it conveys the necessary content while remaining easy to skim and read within approximately 7 minutes.
We estimate posts will be between 1500 and 2000 words in length.

Be sure:

- <GroupAssignment />
- <ClarityAndPresentationReference />
- <ContributionStatementReference />
- <ParticipantAnonymity />

Prepare this initial version of your web post in a Google Doc, submit a link to that document via Canvas here:

<p><CourseInformationLink linkName='linkCanvasAssignment4web' /></p>

Be sure:

- The document can be accessed for commenting by anybody with the link.
- The document uses only simple formatting features (e.g., simple headings, a linear flow of content).
  This is because the document will be converted into Markdown syntax as part of publishing:

  [https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

#### Grading

This initial submission will be used for critique and feedback, but only the final version will be graded.

</CollapseProjectMilestone>

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 4 Web Final
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone heading='4web_final: Web Post' dueDateName='dueDateAssignment4web_final'>

Appropriately revise your web post according to critique and feedback.

If you are unsure what revisions are appropriate, communicate with the course staff well before the final web post is due.

#### Submission

Author your post such that it conveys the necessary content while remaining easy to skim and read within approximately 7 minutes.
We estimate posts will be between 1500 and 2000 words in length.

Submit a single Zip archive file containing all of the files listed below.
Do not upload files individually, as Canvas will mangle the names of your files.

1. __Editable source of your web post__:
   Obtained via the Google Docs "Download" "Microsoft Word" functionality.
   Do not submit a PDF, as this will be much more difficult to move to the web.

2. __Project thumbnail__:
   A 150x150 image appropriate as a thumbnail for your project, named `project_thumb.png`.

3. __An image and preferred name for each member of the project team__:
   Similar to the images of the course staff on the overall course website,
   these will be included in the page generated for your project.
   Provide a file `names.txt` that includes how you want your names presented on the course website.
   Then provide an appropriately named image for each member of the project team (e.g., `james.png`).

4. __All images included in your post__:
   Although these will also be included in your source file,
   provide the original full-quality images for incorporation into your web post.

Be sure:

- <GroupAssignment />
- <ClarityAndPresentationReference />
- <ContributionStatementReference />
- <ParticipantAnonymity />

Your post should be complete and will be evaluated as such.
We will then coordinate with you around any modifications as we integrate your post into the course website
(e.g., to correct any formatting issues).

<CollapseProjectMilestone heading='4poster: Poster and Pitch' dueDateName='dueDateAssignment4poster'>

The goal of this milestone is to create a poster and a pitch that communicate your design to a broad audience.

Create a poster that communicates your design and your design process.
Present your work in a visual form that quickly conveys its most important aspects.
Your poster should include:

- Project Title
- Logo
- Your Names
- Problem
- Value Proposition
- Key Functionality
- Design Process and Iteration

Your poster should emphasize images and include limited amounts of text.
For consistency and ease of display, it should be 32"x40" (i.e., portrait, vertical).
A PowerPoint template is available here:

<p><a href={path4posterTemplate}>poster_template.pptx</a></p>

You should heavily modify the template to be unique and represent your project.

During the final poster session, your team will give a one minute pitch to a small group of judges.
Create a pitch that summarizes the problem and your design.
This pitch should convince an audience that your problem was worth investigating and that your design suggests a compelling direction.
