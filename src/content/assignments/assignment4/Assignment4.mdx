# Assignment 4: Communicating Your Design

<Alert severity='error'>Content is Under Development and Subject to Change</Alert>

## Overview

You have identified a problem, explored a design space, selected a promising design, and iterated on that design.
It is now time to focus on communicating your design and your design process.
This group assignment communicates your design through a __poster__ and an associated __pitch__.

## Milestones

This is a group assignment, consisting of six milestones.

* [Assignment 4a: Initial Poster and Pitch](#id-4a-initial-poster-and-pitch)

  <p><CourseInformationDueDate dueDateName='dueDateAssignment4a' /></p>

* [Assignment 4b: Final Poster and Pitch](#id-4b-final-poster-and-pitch)

  <p><CourseInformationDueDate dueDateName='dueDateAssignment4b' /></p>

* [Assignment 4p: Poster Session](#id-4p-poster-session)

  <p><CourseInformationDueDate dueDateName='dueDateAssignment4p' /></p>

## Deliverables

### 4a: Initial Poster and Pitch

<p><CourseInformationDueDate dueDateName='dueDateAssignment4a' /></p>

The goal of this milestone is to create a poster and a pitch that communicate your design to a broad audience.

Create a poster that communicates your design and your design process.
Present your work in a visual form that quickly conveys its most important aspects.
Your poster should include:

- Project Title
- Logo
- Your Names
- Problem
- Value Proposition
- Key Functionality
- Design Process and Iteration

Your poster should emphasize images and include limited amounts of text.
For consistency and ease of display, it should be 32"x40" (i.e., portrait, vertical).
A PowerPoint template is available here:

{/*
[Cow Project PowerPoint template](/assets/samples/4a/poster_template.ppt)
*/}

You should heavily modify the template to be unique and represent your project.

During the final poster session, your team will give a one minute pitch to a small group of judges.
Create a pitch that summarizes the problem and your design.
This pitch should convince an audience that your problem was worth investigating and that your design suggests a compelling direction.

{/*
**In-Class Exercise**:
In addition to your submission, bring two 8.5"x11" printed copies of your poster to class (i.e., color prints on normal-sized paper).
You will need these for in-class critique.
*/}

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __10 points__:

- __Content__: (5 points)
  - Includes all of the key content listed above.
  - Key functionality of the design is clear.
  - Gives insight into the design process.
- __Clarity and Presentation__: (5 points)
  - Appropriately large images that convey key aspects of the design.
  - Text is minimal and appropriate, large and legible.
  - Colors and fonts are a pleasing combination and easy to read.

Your poster should be complete and will be evaluated as such.
Later critique and refinement will help further improve it before a final version.

### 4b: Final Poster and Pitch

<p><CourseInformationDueDate dueDateName='dueDateAssignment4b' /></p>

Appropriately revise your poster according to feedback.

If you are unsure what revisions are appropriate, communicate with the course staff well before the due date.

During the final poster session, your team will give a one minute pitch to a small group of judges.
Rehearse a pitch that summarizes the problem and your design.
This pitch should convince an audience that your problem was worth investigating and that your design suggests a compelling direction.
